Team members: Darshan Dhillon-Kusek, Ngan Dinh, Jason Ji, Ronald Miranda-Guzman, Duyen Nguyen, Nicholas Terrazas, Han Thai

High-level project description:
•	Create a mapping system that allows users to track the histories of identified entities in specified areas. Extrapolate from that data to make predictions regarding the future locations of these entities at a given point in the future.
•	MongoDB-based application that can store various data types streamed to it.
•	This application is used to aid teams in collaborating and coordinating their operations, especially in an emergency management/disaster relief environment. 
•	It is important to be able to understand where teams have been, what types of communications and coordination have taken place, and what future events may take place for a variety of reasons.
•	Using this data as a foundation, the user shall be able to conduct queries using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface (either voice or text). 
•	Provide Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) analysis of that data to provide the user with query answers and possible conclusions from data analysis using a browser front end.

▪ Who has been in this region for the past 2 weeks?
